    "- **Confounder:** A variable that influences both the explanatory variable (X) and the outcome (Y). If not controlled, it creates a spurious correlation.  \n",
    "- **Collider:** A variable that is affected by two (or more) variables. Conditioning on a collider can induce a false correlation between its causes.  \n",
    "- **Mediator:** A variable that lies on the causal pathway between X and Y, transmitting part of the effect of X on Y.  \n",
